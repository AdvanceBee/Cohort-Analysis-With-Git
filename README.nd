# 📊 Cohort Analysis & Customer Retention Project

This project performs a full lifecycle customer analytics pipeline using e-commerce transaction data. It includes cohort analysis, churn modeling, RFM segmentation, customer lifetime value forecasting (BG/NBD), machine learning for churn prediction, and actionable recommendations.

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives
- Calculate and analyze customer **retention rates** over time
- Segment customers using **RFM features** and clustering (K-Means)
- Predict **future transactions** using the **BG/NBD** model
- Build a **churn prediction model** using Random Forest
- Evaluate models with **MAE and RMSE**
- Deliver **data-driven business recommendations**

---

## 📁 Dataset Description
The dataset includes e-commerce transactions with the following key fields:
- `InvoiceNo`, `StockCode`, `Description`, `Quantity`
- `InvoiceDate`, `UnitPrice`, `CustomerID`, `Country`

A new column `TotalPrice` was created = `Quantity × UnitPrice`

---

## 📅 Cohort Analysis
- Customers grouped by **first purchase month** (`CohortMonth`)
- Calculated **CohortIndex** to track retention monthly
- Built **cohort retention matrix** and plotted **retention heatmaps**

### 🔍 Insights:
- Most customers churn after 1 month
- Retention is slightly improving in recent cohorts

---

## 📉 Churn Analysis
- Defined churn as **no purchase in the past 90 days**
- Visualized churn timing with a **line chart by CohortIndex**

### 🔍 Insights:
- Churn peaks between **Month 1 and 2**
- Majority of customers drop off within first 60 days

---

## 💰 RFM Feature Engineering
- **Recency**: Days since last purchase
- **Frequency**: Unique invoice counts
- **Monetary**: Total spend
- Features were scaled using `StandardScaler`

---

## 🔄 K-Means Clustering
- Customers segmented into **4 clusters** based on RFM
- Profiled clusters to identify VIPs, loyalists, at-risk, and new customers

---

## 🔮 Predictive Modeling: BG/NBD
- Used `lifetimes` to forecast future purchases
- Identified high-value customers based on **expected orders in 30 days**
- Visualized **predicted purchase distribution**

---

## 🌲 Churn Prediction: Random Forest
- Trained model to classify churn using RFM features
- Achieved **100% accuracy**, **0.0 MAE**, and **0.0 RMSE**
- Visualized **feature importance** (Recency was most important)

---

## 📘 Business Recommendations

### 💎 High-Value Loyal Customers
- Offer **exclusive perks**, early access, loyalty programs

### 🔁 Potential Loyalists
- Use **follow-up emails**, reward next purchases with small discounts

### 🚨 At-Risk / Churning
- Launch **win-back campaigns**, collect exit feedback

### 🌱 New / Occasional
- Create **onboarding series**, upsell gently, use social proof

### 📈 Predictive Highlights
- Use BG/NBD scores + churn risk to **prioritize retention**
- Feed model outputs into CRM for **automated marketing**

---

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, lifetimes
- Jupyter Notebook + Git for version control

---

## ✅ Status: Project Complete

📌 Next Steps:
- Extend churn model with additional behavioral features
- Deploy insights into CRM or email marketing tools
- Continue pushing updates and experiments to GitHub
