Cohort Analysis & Customer Retention Project

This project performs a full lifecycle customer analytics pipeline using e-commerce transaction data. It includes cohort analysis, churn modeling, RFM segmentation, customer lifetime value forecasting (BG/NBD), machine learning for churn prediction, and actionable recommendations.

---
Project Objectives
- Calculate and analyze customer retention rates over time
- Segment customers using RFM features and clustering (K-Means)
- Predict future transactions using the BG/NBD model
- Build a churn prediction model using Random Forest
- Evaluate models with MAE and RMSE
- Deliver data-driven business recommendations

---
Dataset Description
The dataset includes e-commerce transactions with the following key fields:
- InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity
- InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country

A new column `TotalPrice` was created = `Quantity × UnitPrice`

---
Cohort Analysis
- Customers grouped by first purchase month (CohortMonth)
- Calculated CohortIndex to track retention monthly
- Built cohort retention matrix and plotted retention heatmaps

Insights:
- Most customers churn after 1 month
- Retention is slightly improving in recent cohorts

---
Churn Analysis
- Defined churn as no purchase in the past 90 days
- Visualized churn timing with a line chart by CohortIndex

Insights:
- Churn peaks between Month 1 and 2
- Majority of customers drop off within first 60 days

---
RFM Feature Engineering
- Recency: Days since last purchase
- Frequency: Unique invoice counts
- Monetary: Total spend
- Features were scaled using StandardScaler

---

K-Means Clustering
- Customers segmented into 4 clusters based on RFM
- Profiled clusters to identify VIPs, loyalists, at-risk, and new customers

---
Predictive Modeling: BG/NBD
- Used lifetimes to forecast future purchases
- Identified high-value customers based on expected orders in 30 days
- Visualized **predicted purchase distribution

---

Churn Prediction: Random Forest
- Trained model to classify churn using RFM features
- Achieved 100% accuracy, 0.0 MAE, and 0.0 RMSE
- Visualized **feature importance** (Recency was most important)

---

Business Recommendations
High-Value Loyal Customers
- Offer exclusive perks, early access, loyalty programs

Potential Loyalists
- Use follow-up emails, reward next purchases with small discounts

At-Risk / Churning
- Launch win-back campaigns, collect exit feedback
 New / Occasional
- Create onboarding series, upsell gently, use social proof

 Predictive Highlights
- Use BG/NBD scores + churn risk to prioritize retention
- Feed model outputs into CRM for automated marketing

---
Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, lifetimes
- Jupyter Notebook + Git for version control

---
Status: Project Complete
Next Steps:
- Extend churn model with additional behavioral features
- Deploy insights into CRM or email marketing tools
- Continue pushing updates and experiments to GitHub
